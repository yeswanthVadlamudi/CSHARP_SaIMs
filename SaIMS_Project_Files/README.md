To fellow coder/programmer,

I encourage you to use this as a template to your work and build on what I have done here and not submit assignments and Computer Science NEA's with this code.
It is not a good practice to pass off ones work as your own, this repository is for my personal showcase and a source of inspiration for you to asses the flaws and logic and improve your own work

I am trusting you, best of luck in your endeavours!
